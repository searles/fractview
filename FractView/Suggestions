* Bug fixing:
** LastArc should be between 0 and 1 [No, now it is easier to edit anyways]
** Colorizations should have better names 
** Mention that + creates a random color. 

** New functions:
*** Add a function |zr| + i |zi|, name: abs; rename current abs to rad, and arg to arc. [done, called it 'cabs']
*** Add a function polar z -> abs z + i arg z
*** Add a function sgn z -> sgn zr + i sgn zi

TODOs:
1. Bookmarks must definitely be in SQLite, but with the possibility to export them
Store last fractal and restore it. 
Allow restoring only parts of bookmarks like color palette
2. Predefined fractals + custom colorization methods (requires Sum/Product; min index value can be obtained from minIndex(Var))
4. 2-dim color palettes
6. dragging parameters
7. Split view for julia next to mandel (TODO for this: boolean set(String label, Cplx value) returns false when no such point).
8. Transfer into palette
9. Caching

** Caching
*** Allow min/max-values in Bailout/lake.
** Colorization from http://www.fractalforums.com/new-theories-and-research/a-new-look-into-escapetime-fractals-using-abs-and-inner-coloring/
** Bookmarks: How to do it? Create parse-method in every object, like Palette, Function etc...? Most likely, yes. For bitmap use Base64 encoding.
*** Add 'pick from bookmark'
