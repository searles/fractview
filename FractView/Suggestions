Palette [done]:
* Padding + Textview + Single-Choice-Listview. For this we should be able to use ArrayAdapter.
* Use icons for buttons.

Bookmark:
* Add possibility to delete a bookmark (long click opens dialog [most extensible solution]).
* Click on bookmark selects it and closes the dialog [na, problem of clicks]
* Find a possibility to pull in default bookmarks.
* Theoretically: Import + Export of bookmarks [Long term].
* Add time to view
* A bit space between title and preview image

Save [done]:
* Add checkboxes to Save/Share image:
  [ ] Share image
  [ ] Set as wallpaper
* Use 'short description' as filename
* TODO Create text-file containing extended information on the image.

Transfer:
* Make a nicer line (holo_blue)

First, get transfer for value, then collect statistics.
So:
---------------------------------
Transfer [ v Log ]
[ ] Custom Range: _______ _______

For this purpose create Range-Object. Image could create one automatically with
appropriate values if the one provided is null (= unchecked)

Stats is already such a Range-Object.

Menu [done]:
* Save/Share, Bookmark, Open Bookmarks.
* Menu -> Function, Iterations, Scale, Transfer, Colors. Resize.

EscapeTime [partly done]:
* Two new methods in Prefs: getShortDescription() and getLongDescription().

Colorizations:
* Maybe new colorizations?

Resize [done]:
* Avoid having width/height of 0

Manual:
* + adds random color
* New functions cabs + polar

TODOs:
2. Predefined fractals + custom colorization methods (requires Sum/Product; min index value can be obtained from minIndex(Var))
4. 2-dim color palettes
6. dragging parameters
7. Split view for julia next to mandel (TODO for this: boolean set(String label, Cplx value) returns false when no such point).

** Colorization from http://www.fractalforums.com/new-theories-and-research/a-new-look-into-escapetime-fractals-using-abs-and-inner-coloring/

Palette Item: Set padding and allow selection in list. Use TextView and always show color.
